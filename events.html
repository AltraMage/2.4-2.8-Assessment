            <section><h2>About: </h2><p>Set up by two local mums with a passion for craft and design who saw a gap in the "market" to have a regular craft market in the Northern Suburbs. From this vision, Tawa Pop Up Market was created. This initiative is seen as a community event involving local stallholders, businesses and schools and a way to showcase what Tawa has to offer. </p></section>

            <section><h2>Menzshed</h2><p>Following a public meeting in October 2016, a group decided that a shed could be established in Tawa.  Since then, we have 100 sq mtr available at the Wellington Rural Fire Force Building, 86 Oxford St, Tawa and have been in business since August 2017. Unfortunately the building is currently not accessible via our address, which is blocked by a condemned bridge. Please drive in via Davies Street, past the Tawa Swimming Pool and car parks, then head south along the drive to the Rural Fire Building.</p></section>
